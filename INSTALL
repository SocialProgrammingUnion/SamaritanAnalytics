TO get this running you just need to put the contents of the blog directory in the /opt/flask_blog directory.  You will need mysql running and import the SPU tables.  You can use the docker mariadb image or the centos image or a combination of both running within the docker vm.  As long as the db is accessible to the app server it should not matter how you configure your docker image.  Take a look at settings.py.

you will need python, setup_tools, and pip on your app server.
The db will need mysql and utilities.

I'll get to work on a build script.

# Where you extracted the SPU_BLOG directory
from flask_blog directory:

DIRECTORY_FOR_flask_blog = ''

docker build -t flask_blog .
docker run --name db -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=test -d -p 3306:3306 mariadb
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 -v $DIRECTORY_FOR_flask_blog/:/opt/flask-blog --name web --link db:mysql flask-intro-mysql
#from a seperate shell
docker run --name mysql-client -it --link db:mysql --rm mariadb sh -c 'exec mysql -uroot -ptest -hmysql'

# from app server
pip install -r requirements.txt

python dbinit.py

python tests.py

python manage.py runserver

#If you are running in docker don't forget the docker IP is what serves the web, not localhost.

##Troubleshooting
python manage.py shell

#That should work
