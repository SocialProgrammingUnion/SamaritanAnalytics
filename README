TO get this running you just need to put the contents of the blog directory in the /opt/flask_blog directory.  You will need mysql running and import the SPU tables.  You can use the docker mariadb image or the centos image or a combination of both running within the docker vm.  As long as the db is accessible to the app server it should not matter how you configure your docker image.  Take a look at settings.py.

you will need python, setup_tools, and pip on your app server.
The db will need mysql and utilities.

I'll get to work on a build script.

from flask_blog directory:

pip install -r requirements.txt

python dbinit.py

python tests.py

python manage.py runserver

##Troubleshooting
python manage.py shell
