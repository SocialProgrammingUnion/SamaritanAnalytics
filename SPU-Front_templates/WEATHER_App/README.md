**This is a basic interface for the openweather api.**   

A full application can be coded rapidly if required.  

Currently looking at the werkzeug request object model.  
Might need a replacement.  

**You will need an api key and an app.secretkey in the index.py file**

the secret key you can generate yourself  
The API key obtain from http://openweathermap.org/
