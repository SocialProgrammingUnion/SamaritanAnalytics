                    <strong>In order to become a member, a user must submit a script, Jupyter Notebook or module for incorporation into the SPU social framework or own and operate a social web site.</strong>  The framework is a series of exercies,  workbooks and modules that demonstrate issues that have been verified by voting members of the union as important issues.  In adddition to the social framework, election software will be provisioned so that SPU fronts can contribute votes from their site on proposed social issues.  <strong>Verified members of the SPU can apply to administer election relays.</strong>
